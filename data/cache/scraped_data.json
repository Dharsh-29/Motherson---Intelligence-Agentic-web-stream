The Company based its assumptions and estimates on parameters available when the financial statements were\nprepared. Existing circumstances and assumptions about future developments, however, may change due to market change or\ncircumstances arising beyond the control of the Company. Such changes are reflected in the assumptions when they occur.\n(i) Useful life of property, plant and equipment and intangibles\nThe Company uses its technical expertise along with historical and industry trends for determining the economic useful life\nof an asset/component of an asset. The useful lives are reviewed by management periodically and revised, if appropriate. In\ncase of a revision, the unamortised amount is charged over the remaining useful life of the assets.\n(ii) Defined benefit plans\nThe cost of the defined benefit gratuity plan and other post-employment defined benefits are determined using actuarial\nvaluations. An actuarial valuation involves various assumptions that may differ from actual developments in the future. These\ninclude the determination of the discount rate, future salary increases and mortality rates. Due to the complexities involved\nin the valuation and its long-term nature, a defined benefit obligation is highly sensitive to changes in these assumptions. All\nassumptions are reviewed at each reporting date.\nFurther details about gratuity obligations are given in Note 17.\n(iii) Taxes\nUncertainties exist with respect to the interpretation of complex tax regulations, changes in tax laws, and the amount\nand timing of future taxable income. Given the nature of business differences arising between the actual results and the\nassumptions made, or future changes to such assumptions, could necessitate future adjustments to tax income and expense\nalready recorded. The Company creates provisions, based on reasonable estimates. The amount of such provisions is based\non various factors, such as experience of previous tax audits and differing interpretations of tax regulations by the taxable\nentity and the responsible tax authority. Such differences of interpretation may arise on a wide variety of issues depending on\nthe conditions prevailing in the respective domicile of the companies.\nValuation of recoverable income tax assets especially with respect to deferred tax assets on the tax loss carry forwards.\nThe Company is subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions. Significant judgement is required in determining the\nprovision for income taxes. The Company recognises liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on estimates of whether\nadditional taxes will be due. Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially\nrecorded, such differences will impact the current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities in the period in which such\ndetermination is made.\n178 motherson sumi wiring india limited annual report 2023-2024 179\ntnempiuqe\ndna\ntnalp\n,ytreporP\n)a(3\nlatipaC\nlatoT\nselciheV\nsretupmoC\neciffO\nerutinruF\n&\ntnalP\ndlohesaeL\n*sgnidliuB\nsralucitraP\nni\nkrow\nstnempiuqe\nserutxif\n&\nyrenihcaM\nstnemevorpmI\nssergorp\ntsoc\ntA\ntnuoma\ngniyrrac\nssorG\n323\n194,4\n61\n592\n38\n82\n960,4\n-\n-\n2202\n,10\nlirpA\nta\nsA\n655\n112,1\n3\n521\n22\n61\n910,1\n62\n-\nsnoitiddA\n-\n)95(\n)3(\n)42(\n)2(\n0\n)03(\n-\n-\nslasopsiD\n)906(\n906\n-\n-\n-\n-\n6\n-\n306\nrefsnarT\n072\n252,6\n61\n693\n301\n44\n460,5\n62\n306\ntnuoma\ngniyrrac\nssorg\ngnisolC\nnoitaicerped\ndetalumuccA\n-\n207,2\n9\n932\n46\n32\n763,2\n-\n-\n2202\n,10\nlirpA\nta\nsA\n-\n245\n3\n84\n11\n3\n464\n1\n21\nraey\neht\nrof\negrahc\nnoitaicerpeD\n-\n)75(\n)3(\n)42(\n)2(\n-\n)82(\n-\n-\nslasopsiD\n-\n781,3\n9\n362\n37\n62\n308,2\n1\n21\nnoitaicerped\ndetalumucca\ngnisolC\n072\n560,3\n7\n331\n03\n81\n162,2\n52\n195\ntnuoma\ngniyrrac\nteN\ntnuoma\ngniyrrac\nssorG\n072\n252,6\n61\n693\n301\n44\n460,5\n62\n306\n3202\n,10\nlirpA\nta\nsA\n243\n250,1\n01\n54\n7\n2\n878\n96\n14\nsnoitiddA\n-\n)24(\n)1(\n)81(\n)3(\n-\n)02(\n-\n-\nslasopsiD\n)573(\n573\n1\n9\n2\n2\n291\n951\n01\nrefsnarT\n732\n736,7\n62\n234\n901\n84\n411,6\n452\n456\ntnuoma\ngniyrrac\nssorg\ngnisolC\nnoitaicerped\ndetalumuccA\n-\n781,3\n9\n362\n37\n62\n308,2\n1\n21\n3202\n,10\nlirpA\nta\nsA\n-\n127\n5\n37\n01\n4\n665\n04\n32\nraey\neht\nrof\negrahc\nnoitaicerpeD\n\n\n[Table 1 on Page 90]\nssergorp\nlatipaC ni\nkrow |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | \nlatoT |  |  | 194,4 | 112,1 | )95( | 906 | 252,6 |  | 207,2 | 245 | )75( | 781,3 | 560,3 |  | 252,6 | 250,1 | )24( | 573 | 736,7 |  | 781,3 | 127\nselciheV |  |  | 61 | 3 | )3( | -
